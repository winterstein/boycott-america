# Our Aims

We are not anti-American. Our aim is not to harm America.
The actions taken by America harm the world, and the world has the right to react.

More specifically, the USA is ignoring their role in climate change,
as exemplified by President Donald Trump's decision to leave the
international Paris Agreement on tackling climate change.

Our aim is to send a message to the USA, to those in power there.
Not an online petition they can dismiss, but a message written 
in a language they understand: money.

The future is worth defending.
