Climate Change is a serious threat. For many people around the world it is already a life or death issue. 
In sub-Saharan Africa, climate change is triggering more extreme drought[1]. In Bangladesh, rising sea levels - brought on by melting ice and warming seas - are forcing people to abandon their homes [2]. These problems will get worse. The effects of carrying on polluting without change would be catastrophic for all of us.

The Paris Agreement is not perfect, but it is a major step forward. 
The EU, China, India -- in fact every other country except for Syria and Nicaragua -- have signed the Paris Agreement. 

By pulling America, the 2nd biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, out of the Paris Agreement, US President Donald Trump has endangered all our futures. 
Donald Trump is not alone in the US: many US politicians hold similar views, or are content to ignore the issue. We have to convince America to act.

Until the United States of America joins the international community in tackling climate change,
I pledge that:

[ ] I will not visit the USA.

[ ] I will buy American last: if there is an alternative non-US product or company available, I will choose them.

[ ] I will not invest in America.

[ ] I will make an exception for companies that are carbon-neutral.


List some American companies you will be boycotting: (e.g. Coca-Cola)

We will notify these companies. You can also write to them yourself, which is the most effective.

# Our Aims

We are not anti-American. Our aim is not to harm America.
The actions taken by America harm the world, and the world has the right to react.

More specifically, the USA is ignoring their role in climate change,
as exemplified by President Donald Trump's decision to leave the
international Paris Agreement on tackling climate change.

Our aim is to send a message to the USA, to those in power there.
Not an online petition they can dismiss, but a message written 
in a language they understand: money.

We need America to change: we all share the Earth's climate, 
it is not acceptable for America to wreck the environment. This boycott will end as soon as America
starts tackling climate change.

We encourage everyone to treat Americans with full respect.
Many Americans agree that change is needed. Those that don't understand -- at this point,
it is a form of denial -- shouting at people will not help. This boycott is for 
meaningful pressure where it can make a difference.

The future is worth defending.
