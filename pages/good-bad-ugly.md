# Good US Companies

We want to compile a list of American companies who are working to tackle climate change.
These companies are excluded from the boycott.

Please contact us to help build this list. To be listed, we require an official report
stating a solid plan based around real action (good intentions are not enough).

## Google

Google have a zero carbon footprint policy.

> We tackle these projects because they reduce our company’s environmental impact, and also because they improve our bottom line. But mostly we do this stuff because it needs to be done and it’s the right thing to do. Google has been carbon neutral since 2007, and in 2017 we’ll reach 100% renewable energy for our operations, including our data centers and offices. But our ambitions don’t end at our own door. Climate change is real. We’re a global company, and our goal is to give everyone everywhere the tools and opportunities they need to play their own part in protecting the planet.
